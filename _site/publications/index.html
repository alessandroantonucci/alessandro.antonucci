<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Structural causal models are the basic modelling unit in Pearl’s causal theory; in principle they allow us to solve counterfactuals, which are at the top rung of the ladder of causation. But they often contain latent variables that limit their application to special settings. This appears to be a consequence of the fact, proven in this paper, that causal inference is NP-hard even in models characterised by polytree-shaped graphs. To deal with such a hardness, we introduce the causal EM algorithm. Its primary aim is to reconstruct the uncertainty about the latent variables from data about categorical manifest variables. Counterfactual inference is then addressed via standard algorithms for Bayesian networks. The result is a general method to approximately compute counterfactuals, be they identifiable or not (in which case we deliver bounds). We show empirically, as well as by deriving credible intervals, that the approximation we provide becomes accurate in a fair number of EM runs. These results lead us finally to argue that there appears to be an unnoticed limitation to the trending idea that counterfactual bounds can often be computed without knowledge of the structural equations.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are a class of structured-decomposable probabilistic circuits especially designed to embed logical constraints. To adapt the classical LearnSPN scheme to learn the structure of these models, we propose a new scheme based on a partial closed-world assumption: data implicitly provide the logical base of the circuit. Sum nodes are thus learned by recursively clustering batches in the initial data base, while the partitioning of the variables obeys a given input vtree. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed approach might properly fit training data, and generalize well to test data, provided that these remain consistent with the underlying logical base, that is a relaxation of the training data base.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We introduce ADAPQUEST, a software tool writ- ten in Java for the development of adaptive ques- tionnaires based on Bayesian networks. Adaptiveness is intended here as the dynamical choice of the question sequence on the basis of an evolving model of the skill level of the test taker. Bayesian networks offer a flexible and highly interpretable framework to describe such testing process, especially when coping with multiple skills. ADAPQUEST embeds dedicated elicitation strategies to simplify the elicitation of the questionnaire parameters. An application of this tool for the diag- nosis of mental disorders is also discussed together with some implementation details.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are a popular class of imprecise prob- abilistic graphical models obtained as a Bayesian net- work generalization based on, so-called credal, sets of probability mass functions. A Java library called CREMA has been recently released to model, process and query credal networks. Despite the NP-hardness of the (exact) task, a number of algorithms is available to approximate credal network inferences. In this paper we present CREPO, an open repository of synthetic credal networks, provided together with the exact re- sults of inference tasks on these models. A Python tool is also delivered to load these data and interact with CREMA, thus making extremely easy to evaluate and compare existing and novel inference algorithms. To demonstrate such benchmarking scheme, we propose an approximate heuristic to be used inside variable elimination schemes to keep a bound on the maximum number of vertices generated during the combination step. A CREPO-based validation against approximate procedures based on linearization and exact techniques performed in CREMA is finally discussed.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A test is adaptive when the sequence and number of ques- tions is dynamically tuned on the basis of the estimated skills of the taker. Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, are used for adaptive tests as they allow to model the uncertainty about the questions and the skills in an explainable fashion, especially when coping with multiple skills. A better elicitation of the uncertainty in the question/skills relations can be achieved by interval probabilities. This turns the model into a credal net- work, thus increasing the inferential complexity of the queries required to select questions. This is especially the case for the information-theoretic quantities used as scores to drive the adaptive mechanism. We present an alternative family of scores, based on the mode of the posterior proba- bilities, and hence easier to explain. This makes considerably simpler the evaluation in the credal case, without significantly affecting the quality of the adaptive process. Numerical tests on synthetic and real-world data are used to support this claim.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>When coping with literary texts such as novels or short stories, the extraction of structured informa- tion in the form of a knowledge graph might be hindered by the huge number of possible relations between the entities corresponding to the characters in the novel and the consequent hurdles in gathering supervised information about them. Such issue is addressed here as an unsupervised task empow- ered by transformers: relational sentences in the original text are embedded (with SBERT) and clustered in order to merge together semantically simi- lar relations. All the sentences in the same cluster are finally summarized (with BART) and a descriptive label extracted from the summary. Preliminary tests show that such clustering might successfully detect similar relations, and provide a valuable pre- processing for semi-supervised approaches.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>In recent years probabilistic model checking has become an important area of research because of the diffusion of computational systems of stochastic nature. Despite its great success, standard probabilistic model checking suffers the limitation of requiring a sharp specification of the probabilities governing the model behaviour. The theory of imprecise probabilities offers a natural approach to overcome such limitation by a sensitivity analysis with respect to the values of these parameters. However, only extensions based on discrete-time imprecise Markov chains have been considered so far for such a robust approach to model checking. We present a further extension based on imprecise Markov reward models. In particular, we derive efficient algorithms to compute lower and upper bounds of the expected cumulative reward and probabilistic bounded rewards based on existing results for imprecise Markov chains. These ideas are tested on a real case study involving the spend-down costs of geriatric medicine departments.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Stochastic multi-agent systems raise the necessity to extend probabilistic model checking to the epistemic domain. Results in this direction have been achieved by epistemic extensions of Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic and related Probabilistic Interpreted Systems. The latter, however, suffer of an important limitation: they require the probabilities governing the system’s behaviour to be fully specified. A promising way to overcome this limitation is represented by imprecise probabilities. In this paper we introduce imprecise probabilistic interpreted systems and present a related logical language and model-checking procedures based on recent advances in the study of imprecise Markov processes.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Missing data present a challenge for most machine learning approaches. When a generative probabilistic model of the data is available, an effective approach is to marginalize missing values out. Probabilistic circuits are expressive generative models that allow for efficient exact inference. However, data is often missing not at random, and marginalization can lead to overconfident and wrong conclusions. In this work, we develop an efficient algorithm for assessing the robustness of classifications made by probabilistic circuits to imputations of the non- ignorable portion of missing data at prediction time. We show that our algorithm is exact when the model satisfies certain constraints, which is the case for the recent proposed Generative Random Forests, that equip Random Forest Classifiers with a full probabilistic model of the data. We also show how to extend our approach to handle non-ignorable missing data at training time.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Lexical semantic change detection (also known as semantic shift tracing) is a task of identifying words that have changed their meaning over time. Unsupervised semantic shift tracing, focal point of SemEval2020, is particularly challenging. Given the unsupervised setup, in this work, we propose to identify clusters among different occurrences of each target word, considering these as representatives of different word meanings. As such, disagreements in obtained clusters naturally allow to quantify the level of semantic shift per each target word in four target languages. To leverage this idea, clustering is performed on contextualized (BERT-based) embeddings of word occurrences. The obtained results show that our approach performs well both measured separately (per language) and overall, where we surpass all provided SemEval baselines.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are logic circuits where the inputs of disjunctive gates are annotated by probability values. They allow for a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually “learned” from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we develop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities with (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference algorithms are derived for these models. These allow to compute: (i) the lower and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables; (ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation of the other variables. These inferences are tractable, as all the three algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the circuit size. The first algorithm is always exact, while the remaining two might induce a conservative (outer) approximation in the case of multiply connected circuits. A semantics for this approximation together with an auxiliary algorithm able to decide whether or not the result is exact is also provided together with a brute-force characterization of the exact inference in these cases. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic circuits are deep probabilistic models with neural-network-like semantics capable of accurately and efficiently answering probabilistic queries without sacrificing expressiveness. Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) are a subclass of probabilistic circuits able to embed logical constraints to the circuit’s structure. In doing so, they obtain extra expressiveness with empirical optimal performance. Despite achieving competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art competitors, there have been very few attempts at learning PSDDs from a combination of both data and knowledge in the form of logical formulae. Our work investigates sampling random PSDDs consistent with domain knowledge and evaluating against state-of-the-art probabilistic models. We propose a method of sampling that retains important structural constraints on the circuit’s graph that guarantee query tractability. Finally, we show that these samples are able to achieve competitive performance even on larger domains.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We present CREDICI, a Java open-source tool for causal inference based on credal networks. Credal networks are an extension of Bayesian networks where local probability mass functions are only constrained to belong to given, so-called credal, sets. CREDICI is based on the recent work of Zaffalon et al. (2020), where an equivalence between Pearl’s structural causal models and credal networks has been derived. This allows to reduce a counterfactual query in a causal model to a standard query in a credal network, even in the case of unidentifiable causal effects. The necessary transformations and data structures are implemented in CREDICI, while inferences are eventually computed by CREMA (Huber et al., 2020), a twin library for general credal network inference. Here we discuss the main implementation challenges and possible outlooks.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We present CREMA (Credal Models Algorithms), a Java library for inference in credal networks. These models are analogous to Bayesian networks, but their local parameters are only con- strained to vary in, so-called credal, sets. Inference in credal networks is intended as the com- putation of the bounds of a query with respect to those local variations. For credal networks the task is harder than in Bayesian networks, being NPPP-hard in general models. Yet, scalable approximate algorithms have been shown to provide good accuracies on large or dense mod- els, while exact techniques can be designed to process small or sparse models. CREMA embeds these algorithms and also offers an API to build and query credal networks together with a spec- ification format. This makes CREMA, whose features are discussed and described by a simple example, the most advanced tool for credal network modelling and inference developed so far.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A structural causal model is made of endogenous (manifest) and exogenous (latent) variables. We show that endogenous observations induce linear constraints on the probabilities of the exogenous variables. This allows to exactly map a causal model into a credal network. Causal inferences, such as interventions and counterfactuals, can consequently be obtained by standard algorithms for the updating of credal nets. These natively return sharp values in the identifiable case, while intervals corresponding to the exact bounds are produced for unidentifiable queries. A characterization of the causal models that allow the map above to be compactly derived is given, along with a discussion about the scalability for general models. This contribution should be regarded as a systematic approach to represent structural causal models by credal networks and hence to systematically compute causal inferences. A number of demonstrative examples is presented to clarify our methodology. Extensive experiments show that approximate algorithms for credal networks can immediately be used to do causal inference in real-size problems.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian net- works (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admit a wide range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction – compiling BNs into SPNs – is well discussed in Darwiche’s seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse direction – decompiling SPNs into BNs – has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm that decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilation process is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of the decompiled SPN.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We present a heuristic strategy for marginal MAP (MMAP) queries in graphical models. The algorithm is based on a reduction of the task to a polynomial number of marginal inference computations. Given an input evidence, the marginals mass functions of the variables to be explained are computed. Marginal information gain is used to decide the variables to be explained first, and their most probable marginal states are consequently moved to the evidence. The sequential iteration of this procedure leads to a MMAP explanation and the minimum information gain obtained during the process can be regarded as a confidence measure for the explanation. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed confidence measure is properly detecting instances for which the algorithm is accurate and, for sufficiently high confidence levels, the algorithm gives the exact solution or an approximation whose Hamming distance from the exact one is small.</details>&nbsp;

After any interaction with the user, a probability mass function over the items is updated by the system. The conversational feature corresponds to a sequential discovery of the user preferences based on questions. Information-theoretic criteria are used to optimally shape the interactions and decide when the conversation ends. Most probable items are consequently recommended. Dedicated elicitation techniques for the prior probabilities of the parameters modelling the interactions are derived from basic structural judgements based on logical compatibility and symmetry assumptions.

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We propose temporal word embeddings as a suitable tool to study the evolution of characters and their sentiments across the plot of a narrative text. The dynamic evolution of instances within a narrative text is a challenging task, where complex behavioral evolutions and other characteristics specific to the narrative text need to be inferred and interpreted. While starting from an existing approach to the learning of these models, we propose an alternative initialization procedure which seems to be especially suited for the case of narrative text. As a validation benchmark, we use the Harry Potter series of books as a challenging case study for such character trait evolution. A benchmark data set based on temporal word analogies related to the characters in the plot of the series is considered. The results are promising, and the empirical validation seems to support the working ideas behind this proposal.</details>&nbsp;

We propose a <i>credal</i> generalisation of the probabilistic quantification of these models, that allows to replace the local probabilities with (credal) sets of mass functions specified by linear constraints. This induces a joint credal set, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the constraints. These models can support cautious estimates of the local parameters when only small amounts of training data are available. Algorithmic strategies to compute lower and upper bounds of marginal and conditional queries are provided. The task can be achieved in linear time with respect to the diagram size for marginal queries. The same can be done for conditional queries if the topology of the circuit is singly connected.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams (PSDDs) are annotated circuits providing a possibly compact specification of joint probability mass functions consistent with a formula over a set of propositional variables. PSDD inference is tractable in the sense that marginal queries can be achieved in linear time with respect to the circuit size by traversal algorithms. Unlike other probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks, the problem of learning the structure for PSDDs received relatively little attention. We discuss some preliminary ideas related to the development of pure likelihood-score-based search methods for the learning of PSDD structures fitting a formula and a data set of consistent observations. A sampling algorithm for these models is also provided.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We focus on the problem of modeling deterministic equations over continuous variables in discrete Bayesian networks. This is typically achieved by a discretisation of both input and output variables and a degenerate quantification of the corresponding conditional probability tables. This approach, based on classical probabilities, cannot properly model the information loss induced by the discretisation. We show that a reliable modeling of such epistemic uncertainty can be instead achieved by credal sets, i.e., convex sets of probability mass functions. This transforms the original Bayesian network in a credal network, possibly returning interval-valued inferences, that are robust with respect to the information loss induced by the discretisation. Algorithmic strategies for an optimal choice of the discretisation bins are also discussed.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A machine learning approach to the creation of visual summaries for narrative text is presented. Standard natural language processing tools for named entities recognition are used together with a clustering algorithm to detect the characters of the novel and their aliases. The most relevant ones and their relations are evaluated on the basis of a simple statistical analysis. These characters are visually depicted as nodes of an undirected graph whose edges describe relations with other characters. Specialized sentiment analysis techniques based on sentence embedding decide the colours of characters/nodes and their relations/edges. Additional information about the characters (e.g., gender) and their relations (e.g., siblings or partnerships) are returned by binary classifiers and visually depicted in the graph. For those specialized tasks, small amounts of manually annotated data are sufficient to achieve good accuracy. Compared to analogous tools, the machine learning approach we present allows for a richer representation of texts of this kind. A case study to demonstrate this approach for a series of books is also reported.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We propose an extension of Poole’s independent choice logic based on a relaxation of the underlying independence assumptions. A credal semantics involving multiple joint probability mass functions over the possible worlds is adopted. This represents a conservative approach to probabilistic logic programming achieved by considering all the mass functions consistent with the probabilistic facts. This allows to model tasks for which independence among some probabilistic choices cannot be assumed, and a specific dependence model cannot be assessed. Preliminary tests on an object ranking application show that, despite the loose underlying assumptions, informative inferences can be extracted.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are a class of arith- metic circuits locally annotated by probability mass functions. This allows for a compact representation of joint mass functions in the presence of logical constraints. Here we propose a set-valued generalisation of the probabilistic quantification in these models, that allows to replace the sharp specification of the local probabilities with linear constraints over them. This induces a (convex) set of joint probability mass functions, all consistent with the assigned logical constraints. These models should be adopted for a cautious learning of the local parameters if only small amount of data are available. Algorithmic strategies to compute the lower and upper bounds of marginal and conditional queries with respect to these sets of joint mass functions are sketched.

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A reliable modeling of uncertain evidence in Bayesian networks based on a set-valued quantification is proposed. Both soft and virtual evidences are considered. We show that evidence propagation in this setup can be reduced to standard updating in an augmented credal network, equivalent to a set of consistent Bayesian networks. A characterization of the computational complexity for this task is derived together with an efficient exact procedure for a subclass of instances. In the case of multiple uncertain evidences over the same variable, the proposed procedure can provide a set-valued version of the geometric approach to opinion pooling.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A credal classifier for multilabel data is presented. This is obtained as an extension of Zaffalon’s naive credal classifier to the case of non-exclusive class labels. The dependence relations among the labels are shaped with a tree topology. The classifier, based on a polynomial-time algorithm to compute whether or not a class label is optimal, returns a compact description of the set of optimal sequences of labels. Extensive experiments on real multilabel data show that the classifier gives more robust predictions than its Bayesian counterpart. In practice, when multiple sequences are returned in output, the Bayesian model is more likely to be inaccurate, while the sequences returned by the credal classifier are more likely to include the correct one.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models used to represent and solve sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Sharp numerical values are required to quantify probabilities and utilities. This might be an issue with real models, whose parameters are typically obtained from expert judgements or partially reliable data. We consider an interval-valued quantification of the parameters to gain realism in the modeling and evaluate the sensitivity of the inferences with respect to perturbations in the sharp values of the parameters. An extension of the classical influence diagrams formalism to support such interval-valued potentials is presented. The variable elimination and arc reversal inference algorithms are generalized to cope with these models. At the price of an outer approximation, the extension keeps the same complexity as with sharp values. Numerical experiments show improved performances with respect to previous methods. As a natural application, we propose these models for practical sensitivity analysis in traditional influence diagrams. The maximum perturbation level on single or multiple parameters preserving the optimal strategy can be computed. This allows the identification of the parameters deserving a more careful elicitation.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Hidden Markov models are popular tools for gesture recognition. Once the generative processes of gestures have been identified, an observation sequence is usually classified as the gesture having the highest likelihood, thus ignoring possible prior information. In this paper, we consider two potential improvements of such methods: the inclusion of prior information, and the possibility of considering convex sets of probabilities (in the likelihoods and the prior) to infer imprecise, but more reliable, predictions when information is insufficient. We apply the proposed approach to technical gestures, typically characterized by severe class imbalance. By modelling such imbalances as a prior information, we achieve more accurate results, while the imprecise quantification is shown to produce more reliable estimates.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used probabilistic models of sequential data. As with other probabilistic models, they require the specification of local conditional probability distributions, whose assessment can be too difficult and error-prone, especially when data are scarce or costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets of, instead of single, probability distributions. iHMMs have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not enough statistical evidence, and can serve as a sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary HMMs. In this paper, we consider iHMMs under the strong independence interpretation, for which we develop efficient infer- ence algorithms to address standard HMM usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most probable explanations, as well as performing filter- ing and predictive inference. Experiments with real data show that iHMMs produce more reliable inferences without compromising the computational efficiency.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal nets are probabilistic graphical models which extend Bayesian nets to cope with sets of distributions. An algorithm for approximate credal network updating is presented. The problem in its general formulation is a multilinear optimization task, which can be linearized by an appropriate rule for fixing all the local models apart from those of a single variable. This simple idea can be iterated and quickly leads to accurate inferences. A transformation is also derived to reduce decision making in credal networks based on the maximality criterion to updating. The decision task is proved to have the same complexity of standard inference, being NP^PP-complete for general credal nets and NP-complete for polytrees. Similar results are derived for the E-admissibility criterion. Numerical experiments confirm a good performance of the method.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A novel technique to classify time series with imprecise hidden Markov models is presented. The learning of these models is achieved by coupling the EM algorithm with the imprecise Dirichlet model. In the stationarity limit, each model corresponds to an imprecise mixture of Gaussian densities, this reducing the problem to the classification of static, imprecise-probabilistic, information. Two classifiers, one based on the expected value of the mixture, the other on the Bhattacharyya distance between pairs of mixtures, are developed. The computation of the bounds of these descriptors with respect to the imprecise quantification of the parameters is reduced to, respectively, linear and quadratic optimization tasks, and hence efficiently solved. Classification is performed by extending the k-nearest neighbors approach to interval-valued data. The classifiers are credal, meaning that multiple class labels can be returned in the output. Experiments on benchmark datasets for computer vision show that these methods achieve the required robustness whilst outperforming other precise and imprecise methods.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models used to represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty. Sharp numerical values are required to quantify probabilities and utilities. Yet, real models are based on data streams provided by partially reliable sensors or experts. We propose an interval-valued quantification of these parameters to gain realism in the modelling and to analyse the sensitivity of the inferences with respect to perturbations of the sharp values. An extension of the classical influence diagrams formalism to support interval-valued potentials is provided. Moreover, a variable elimination algorithm especially designed for these models is developed and evalu- ated in terms of complexity and empirical performances.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Hidden Markov models are popular tools for the modeling of multivariate time series. A set-valued quantification of the parameters might increase realism in the description of non-stationarity. A recent work shows that the computation of the bounds of the likelihood of a sequence with respect to such imprecise quantification can be performed in the same polynomial time of a precise computation with sharp values. This is the basis for a credal classifier of time series. For each training sequence we learn a set-valued model and compute the interval likelihood of the test sequence. The returned classes are those of the models associated to the undominated intervals. The approach is particularly accurate on the instances for which single classes are returned. We therefore apply this method to early classi- fication of streaming data. As soon as the credal classifier returns a single output we assign a class label even if the stream is not terminated. Tests on a speech recognition benchmark suggest that the proposed approach might outperform a thresholding of the precise likelihoods with the classical models.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>In previous work, we devised an approach for multilabel classification based on an ensemble of Bayesian networks. It was characterized by an efficient structural learning and by high accuracy. Its shortcoming was the high computational complexity of the MAP inference, necessary to identify the most probable joint configuration of all classes. In this work, we switch from the ensemble approach to the single model approach. This allows important computational savings. The reduction of inference times is exponential in the difference between the treewidth of the single model and the number of classes. We adopt moreover a more sophisticated approach for the structural learning of the class subgraph. The proposed single models outperforms alternative approaches for multilabel classification such as binary relevance and ensemble of classifier chains.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are graph-based statistical models whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being sharply specified as in traditional statistical models (e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity of inferences on such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper, we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong independence. We show that infer- ences under strong independence are NP-hard even in trees with binary variables except for a single ternary one. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely to extend to more general models (e.g., singly connected topologies). These results clearly distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences and those where inferences are most likely hard, and settle several open questions regarding their computational complexity. We show that these results remain valid even if we disallow the use of zero probabilities. We also show that the computation of bounds on the probability of the future state in a hidden Markov model is the same whether we assume epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we prove a similar result for inference in naive Bayes structures. These inferential equivalences are important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models and naive Bayes structures are used in real applications of imprecise probability.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We study the sensitivity of a MAP configuration of a discrete probabilistic graph- ical model with respect to perturbations of its parameters. These perturbations are global, in the sense that simultaneous perturbations of all the parameters (or any chosen subset of them) are allowed. Our main contribution is an exact algorithm that can check whether the MAP configuration is robust with respect to given per- turbations. Its complexity is essentially the same as that of obtaining the MAP configuration itself, so it can be promptly used with minimal effort. We use our algorithm to identify the largest global perturbation that does not induce a change in the MAP configuration, and we successfully apply this robustness measure in two practical scenarios: the prediction of facial action units with posed images and the classification of multiple real public data sets. A strong correlation between the proposed robustness measure and accuracy is verified in both scenarios.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A software tool especially designed for military domains to create and query decision-support systems is presented. Credal networks, which are Bayesian networks whose parameters have the freedom to vary in convex sets, are used to model the relations among the system variables. A novel elicitation procedure of these sets, which allows the military experts to report their knowledge by purely qualitative judgements, is proposed. Two high-level fusion procedures to cope with multiple experts in this framework are also derived. All these features are supported by the software and demonstrated in an application to space security tested during the last NATO multinational experiment.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>An algorithm for approximate credal network updating is presented. The problem in its general formulation is a multilinear optimization task, which can be linearized by an appropriate rule for fixing all the local models apart from those of a single variable. This simple idea can be iterated and quickly leads to very accurate inferences. The approach can also be specialized to classification with credal networks based on the maximality criterion. A complexity analysis for both the problem and the algorithm is reported together with numerical experiments, which confirm the good performance of the method. While the inner approximation produced by the algorithm gives rise to a classifier which might return a subset of the optimal class set, preliminary empirical results suggest that the accuracy of the optimal class set is seldom affected by the approximate probabilities.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We propose a new methodology to classify temporal data with imprecise hidden Markov models. For each sequence we learn a different model by coupling the EM algorithm with the imprecise Dirichlet model. As a model descriptor, we consider the expected value of the observable variable in the limit of stationarity of the Markov chain. In the imprecise case, only the bounds of this descriptor can be evaluated. In practice the sequence, which can be regarded as a trajectory in the feature space, is summarized by a hyperbox in the same space. We classify these static but interval-valued data by a credal generalization of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets for computer vision show that the method achieves the required robustness whilst outperforming other precise and imprecise methods.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We present a novel approach for multilabel classification based on an ensemble of Bayesian networks. The class variables are connected by a tree; each model of the ensemble uses a different class as root of the tree. We assume the features to be conditionally independent given the classes, thus generalizing the naive Bayes assumption to the multiclass case. This assumption allows us to optimally identify the correlations between classes and features; such correlations are moreover shared across all models of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble via logarithmic opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming loss, we compute the marginal probability of the classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian network in the ensemble, and then pooling the inferences. To instead minimize the subset 0/1 loss, we pool the joint distributions of each model and cast the problem as a MAP inference in the corresponding graphical model. Experiments show that the approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for multilabel classification.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are graph-based statistical models whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being sharply specified as in traditional statistical models (e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity of inferences on such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper, we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong independence. We show that inferences under strong independence are NP-hard even in trees with ternary variables. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial time complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely to extend to more general models (e.g. singly connected networks). These results clearly distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences and those where inferences are most likely hard, and settle several open questions regarding computational complexity.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Bayesian networks are commonly used for classification: a structural
	learning algorithm determines the network graph, while standard approaches
	estimate the model parameters from data. Yet, with few data the corresponding
	assessments can be unreliable. To gain robustness in this phase,
	we consider a likelihood-based learning approach, which takes all

	A new classification algorithm based on this approach is presented.
	Notably, this is a credal classifier, i.e., more than a single class
	can be returned in output. This is the case when the Bayesian networks

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal nets are probabilistic graphical models which extend Bayesian
	nets to cope with sets of distributions. This feature makes the model

	distributions, the identification of the optimal option can be based

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful tools to capture the dynamics
	of a human action by providing a sufficient level of abstraction
	to recognise what two video sequences, depicting the same kind of
	action, have in common. If the sequence is short and hence only few
	data are available, the EM algorithm, which is generally employed
	to learn HMMs, might return unreliable estimates. As a possible solution
	to this problem, a robust version of the EM algorithm, which provides
	an interval-valued quantification of the HMM probabilities is provided.
	This takes place in an imprecise-probabilistic framework, where action

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>The noisy-OR gate is an important tool for a compact elicitation of
	the conditional probabilities of a Bayesian network. An imprecise-probabilistic
	version of this model, where sets instead of single distributions
	are used to model uncertainty about the inhibition of the causal
	factors, is proposed. This transforms the original Bayesian network
	into a so-called credal network. Despite the higher computational
	complexity generally characterizing inference on credal networks,
	it is possible to prove that, exactly as for Bayesian networks, the
	local complexity to update probabilities on an imprecise noisy-OR
	gate takes only linear, instead of exponential, time in the number
	of causes. This result is also extended to fault tree analysis and
	allows for a fast fusion of the causal effects on models with an
	imprecise-probabilistic quantification of the initiating events.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks generalize Bayesian networks by relaxing the requirement
	of precision of probabilities. Credal networks are considerably more
	expressive than Bayesian networks, but this makes belief updating
	NP-hard even on polytrees. We develop a new efficient algorithm for
	approximate belief updating in credal networks. The algorithm is
	based on an important representation result we prove for general
	credal networks: that any credal network can be equivalently reformulated
	as a credal network with binary variables; moreover, the transformation,
	which is considerably more complex than in the Bayesian case, can
	be implemented in polynomial time. The equivalent binary credal network
	is then updated by L2U, a loopy approximate algorithm for binary
	credal networks. Overall, we generalize L2U to non-binary credal
	networks, obtaining a scalable algorithm for the general case, which
	is approximate only because of its loopy nature. The accuracy of
	the inferences with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms
	is evaluated by extensive numerical tests.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal sets are closed convex sets of probability mass functions.
	The lower probabilities specified by a credal set for each element
	of the power set can be used as constraints defining a second credal
	set. This simple procedure produces an outer approximation, with
	a bounded number of extreme points, for general credal sets. The
	approximation is optimal in the sense that no other lower probabilities
	can specify smaller supersets of the original credal set. Notably,
	in order to be computed, the approximation does not need the extreme
	points of the credal set, but only its lower probabilities. This
	makes the approximation particularly suited for credal networks,
	which are a generalization of Bayesian networks based on credal sets.
	Although most of the algorithms for credal networks updating only
	return lower posterior probabilities, the suggested approximation
	can be used to evaluate (as an outer approximation of) the posterior
	credal set. This makes it possible to adopt more sophisticated decision
	making criteria, without having to replace existing algorithms. The

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Knowledge-based systems are computer programs achieving expert-level competence in solving problems for specific task areas. This chapter is a tutorial on the construction of knowledge-based systems in the theoretical framework of credal networks. Credal networks are a generalization of Bayesian networks where credal sets, i.e., closed convex sets of probability measures, are used instead of precise probabilities.  This allows for a more flexible process of elicitation than in the case of Bayesian networks. In fact, credal sets allow to represent ambiguity, contrast and contradiction in a natural and realistic way. The procedure we propose is based on a sharp distinction between the domain knowledge and the process linking this knowledge to the perceived evidence, which we call the observational process. This distinction leads to a very flexible representation of both domain knowledge and knowledge about the way the information is collected, together with a procedure of aggregation of the information coming from the different sources. The overall procedure is illustrated along the chapter by a simple knowledge-based system for the prediction of the result of a football match.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We present a new procedure for tracking manoeuvring objects by hidden
	Markov chains. It leads to more reliable modelling of the transitions
	between hidden states compared to similar approaches proposed within
	the Bayesian framework: we adopt convex sets of probability mass
	functions rather than single ’precise probability’ specifications,
	in order to provide a more realistic and cautious model of the manoeuvre
	dynamics. In general, the downside of such increased freedom in the
	modelling phase is a higher inferential complexity. However, the
	simple topology of hidden Markov chains allows for efficient tracking
	of the object through a recently developed belief propagation algorithm.
	Furthermore, the imprecise specification of the transitions can produce
	so-called indecision, meaning that more than one model may be suggested
	by our method as a possible explanation of the target kinematics.
	In summary, our approach leads to a multiple-model estimator whose
	performance, investigated through extensive numerical tests, turns
	out to be more accurate and robust than that of Bayesian ones.</details>&nbsp;

	Bayesian networks to convex sets of probability mass functions. This
	makes credal networks particularly suited to model expert knowledge
	under very general conditions, including states of qualitative and
	incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we present a credal network
	for risk evaluation in case of intrusion of civil aircrafts into
	a restricted flight area. The different factors relevant for this
	evaluation, together with an independence structure over them, are
	initially identified. These factors are observed by sensors, whose
	reliabilities can be affected by variable external factors, and even
	by the behaviour of the intruder. A model of these observation processes,
	and the necessary fusion scheme for the information returned by the
	sensors measuring the same factor, are both completely embedded into
	the structure of the credal network. A pool of experts, facilitated
	in their task by specific techniques to convert qualitative judgements
	into imprecise probabilistic assessments, has made possible the quantification
	of the network. We show the capabilities of the proposed model by
	means of some preliminary tests referred to simulated scenarios.
	Overall, we can regard this application as a useful tool to support

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models widely employed in AI for the implementation of knowledge-based systems. Standard inference algorithms can update the beliefs about a variable of interest in the network after the observation of some other variables. This is usually achieved under the assumption that the observations could reveal the actual states of the variables in a fully reliable way.  We propose a procedure for a more general modeling of the observations, which allows for updating beliefs in different situations, including various cases of unreliable, incomplete, uncertain and also missing observations. This is achieved by augmenting the original Bayesian network with a number of auxiliary variables corresponding to the observations. For a flexible modeling of the observational process, the quantification of the relations between these auxiliary variables and those of the original Bayesian network is done by credal sets, i.e., convex sets of probability mass functions. Without any lack of generality, we show how this can be done by simply estimating the bounds for the likelihoods of the observations. Overall, the Bayesian network is transformed into a credal network, for which a standard updating problem has to be solved. Finally, a number of transformations that might simplify the updating of the resulting credal network is provided.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are probabilistic graphical models that extend Bayesian
	nets to deal with imprecision in probability, and can actually be
	regarded as sets of Bayesian nets. Credal nets appear to be powerful
	means to represent and deal with many important and challenging problems
	in uncertain reasoning. The counterpart of having more freedom in
	the modeling phase is an increased inferential complexity of inferences,
	e.g., the so-called belief updating becomes a hard task even on relatively
	simple topologies. In this thesis, I start my investigation on credal
	networks by considering equivalent representations of those models.
	More specifically, I first deliver a new graphical language, which
	is called decision-theoretic being inspired by the formalism of decision
	graphs, for a unified representation of credal networks of any kind.
	I also present another representation, which is called binarization,
	being in fact a reformulation of a credal network solely based on
	binary variables. Remarkably, I prove that if a credal net is first
	reformulated by its decision-theoretic representation and then by
	the corresponding binarization, the resulting representation is completely
	equivalent. An equivalence relation between Bayesian and credal nets,
	when the reason for the missingness of some of the variables in the
	Bayesian nets is unknown, is also provided. The developed equivalent
	representations are applied to inference problems. First, I show
	that, by a decision-theoretic formulation, the algorithms that have
	been already designed for credal networks, which are mostly referred
	to a specific class of models, called separately specified nets,
	can be generalized to credal networks of any kind. Similar formalisms
	are also employed to solve inference and classification problems
	with missing observations. I also present a state-ofthe- art updating
	algorithm which is based on the equivalent binary representation.
	This algorithm, called GL2U, offers an efficient procedure for approximate
	updating of general credal nets. The quality of the overall approximation
	is investigated by promising numerical experiments. As a further
	theoretical investigation, I consider a classification problem for
	Bayesian networks for which a hardness proof together with a fast
	algorithm for a subclass of models is provided. Finally, two real-world
	applications of credal networks are presented. First, I consider
	a military identification problem, consisting in the detection of
	the goal of an intruder entering a no-fly area. The problem, together
	with the necessary fusion of the information gathered by the sensors
	is mapped by our techniques into a credal network updating task.
	The solution is then obtained by the GL2U algorithm. The second application
	is an environmental model for hazard assessment of debris flows by
	credal networks. A credal network evaluates the level of risk, corresponding
	to the observed values of the triggering factors, for this specific
	natural hazard. For some factors, whose observations are more difficult,
	the corresponding soft evidential information is embedded by our
	formalism into the structure of the network. This model is employed
	for extensive numerical analysis on the Swiss territory.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal nets generalize Bayesian nets by relaxing the requirement of
	precision of probabilities. Credal nets are considerably more expressive
	than Bayesian nets, but this makes belief updating NP-hard even on
	polytrees. We develop a new efficient algorithm for approximate belief
	updating in credal nets. The algorithm is based on an important representation
	result we prove for general credal nets: that any credal net can
	be equivalently reformulated as a credal net with binary variables;
	moreover, the transformation, which is considerably more complex
	than in the Bayesian case, can be implemented in polynomial time.
	The equivalent binary credal net is updated by L2U, a loopy approximate
	algorithm for binary credal nets. Thus, we generalize L2U to non-binary
	credal nets, obtaining an accurate and scalable algorithm for the
	general case, which is approximate only because of its loopy nature.
	The accuracy of the inferences is evaluated by empirical tests.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are models that extend Bayesian nets to deal with
	imprecision in probability, and can actually be regarded as sets
	of Bayesian nets. Credal nets appear to be powerful means to represent
	and deal with many important and challenging problems in uncertain
	reasoning. We give examples to show that some of these problems can
	only be modeled by credal nets called non-separately specified. These,
	however, are still missing a graphical representation language and
	updating algorithms. The situation is quite the opposite with separately
	specified credal nets, which have been the subject of much study
	and algorithmic development. This paper gives two major contributions.
	First, it delivers a new graphical language to formulate any type
	of credal network, both separately and non-separately specified.
	Second, it shows that any non-separately specified net represented
	with the new language can be easily transformed into an equivalent
	separately specified net, defined over a larger domain. This result
	opens up a number of new outlooks and concrete outcomes: first of
	all, it immediately enables the existing algorithms for separately
	specified credal nets to be applied to non-separately specified ones.
	We explore this possibility for the 2U algorithm: an algorithm for
	exact updating of singly connected credal nets, which is extended
	by our results to a class of non-separately specified models. We
	also consider the problem of inference on Bayesian networks, when
	the reason that prevents some of the variables from being observed
	is unknown. The problem is first reformulated in the new graphical
	language, and then mapped into an equivalent problem on a separately
	specified net. This provides a first algorithmic approach to this
	kind of inference, which is also proved to be NP-hard by similar
	transformations based on our formalism.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Debris flows represent a very destructive natural hazard, affecting
	buildings, transport infrastructures, and, very often, causing human
	losses in mountain regions. That makes the identification of potential
	source areas of debris flows inside a watershed particularly important.
	In this paper we present a general identification procedure based
	on the credal network (that is an imprecise probabilistic graphical
	model generalizing Bayesian networks) originally introduced by Antonucci
	et al. (2004). That model is significantly improved by a more refined
	description of the meteorological and hydrological processes contributing
	to the debris flow initiation. As a counterpart of such improvement,
	the model pays a slight increase in terms of computational time for
	identifications. That does not prevent its extensive, spatially distributed,
	application to whole basins, thanks to a preliminary deterministic
	analysis that rejects local areas where the triggering of a debris
	flow cannot take place. The overall procedure is tested for a debris
	flow prone watershed in Southern Switzerland. The model detects the
	areas in the basin more prone to debris flow initiation and also
	shows that different rainfall return periods produce different patterns
	of hazard in the basin. That makes it possible with this procedure
	to determine the return period of the critical rainfall that triggers
	debris flow as a result of channel-bed failure in a specific point
	along the drainage network.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are imprecise probabilistic graphical models generalizing
	Bayesian networks to convex sets of probability mass functions. This
	makes credal networks particularly suited to capture and model expert
	knowledge under very general conditions, including states of qualitative
	and incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we present a credal network
	for risk evaluation in case of intrusion of civil aircrafts into
	a no-fly zone. The different factors relevant for this evaluation,
	together with an independence structure over them, are initially
	identified. These factors are observed by sensors, whose reliabilities
	can be affected by variable external factors, and even by the behavior
	of the intruder. A model of these observation mechanisms, and the
	necessary fusion scheme for the information returned by the sensors
	measuring the same factor, are both completely embedded into the
	structure of the credal network. A pool of experts, facilitated in
	their task by specific techniques to convert qualitative judgments
	into imprecise probabilistic assessments, has made possible the quantification
	of the network. We show the capabilities of the proposed network
	by means of some preliminary tests referred to simulated scenarios.
	Overall, we can regard this application as an useful tool to support
	military experts in their decision, but also as a quite general imprecise-probability
	paradigm for information fusion.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>According to widely accepted guidelines for self-regulation, the capital
	requirements of a bank should relate to the level of risk with respect
	to three different categories. Among them, operational risk is the
	more difficult to assess, as it requires merging expert judgments
	and quantitative information about the functional structure of the
	bank. A number of approaches to the evaluation of operational risk
	based on Bayesian networks have been recently considered. In this
	paper, we propose credal networks, which are a generalization of
	Bayesian networks to imprecise probabilities, as a more appropriate
	framework for the measurement and management of operational risk.
	The reason is the higher flexibility provided by credal networks
	compared to Bayesian networks in the quantification of the probabilities
	underlying the model: this makes it possible to represent human expertise
	required for these evaluations in a credible and robust way. We use
	a real-world application to demonstrate these features and to show
	how to measure operational risk by means of algorithms for inference
	over credal nets. This is shown to be possible, also in the case
	when the observation of some factor is vague.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Debris flows are destructive natural hazards that affect human life,
	buildings, and infrastructures. Despite their importance, debris
	flows are only partially understood, and human expertise still plays
	a key role for hazard identification. This paper proposes filling
	the modelling gap by using credal networks, an imprecise-probability
	model. The model uses a directed graph to capture the causal relationships
	between the triggering factors of debris flows. Quantitative influences
	are represented by probability intervals, determined from historical
	data, expert knowledge, and theoretical models. Most importantly,
	the model joins the empirical and the quantitative modelling levels,
	in the direction of more credible inferences. The model is evaluated
	on real case studies related to dangerous areas of the Ticino Canton,
	southern Switzerland. The case studies highlight the good capabilities
	of the model: for all the areas the model produces significant probabilities
	of hazard.</details>&nbsp;
