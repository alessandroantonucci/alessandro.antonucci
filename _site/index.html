<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Structural causal models are the basic modelling unit in Pearl’s causal theory; in principle they allow us to solve counterfactuals, which are at the top rung of the ladder of causation. But they often contain latent variables that limit their application to special settings. This appears to be a consequence of the fact, proven in this paper, that causal inference is NP-hard even in models characterised by polytree-shaped graphs. To deal with such a hardness, we introduce the causal EM algorithm. Its primary aim is to reconstruct the uncertainty about the latent variables from data about categorical manifest variables. Counterfactual inference is then addressed via standard algorithms for Bayesian networks. The result is a general method to approximately compute counterfactuals, be they identifiable or not (in which case we deliver bounds). We show empirically, as well as by deriving credible intervals, that the approximation we provide becomes accurate in a fair number of EM runs. These results lead us finally to argue that there appears to be an unnoticed limitation to the trending idea that counterfactual bounds can often be computed without knowledge of the structural equations.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are a class of structured-decomposable probabilistic circuits especially designed to embed logical constraints. To adapt the classical LearnSPN scheme to learn the structure of these models, we propose a new scheme based on a partial closed-world assumption: data implicitly provide the logical base of the circuit. Sum nodes are thus learned by recursively clustering batches in the initial data base, while the partitioning of the variables obeys a given input vtree. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed approach might properly fit training data, and generalize well to test data, provided that these remain consistent with the underlying logical base, that is a relaxation of the training data base.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>We introduce ADAPQUEST, a software tool writ- ten in Java for the development of adaptive ques- tionnaires based on Bayesian networks. Adaptiveness is intended here as the dynamical choice of the question sequence on the basis of an evolving model of the skill level of the test taker. Bayesian networks offer a flexible and highly interpretable framework to describe such testing process, especially when coping with multiple skills. ADAPQUEST embeds dedicated elicitation strategies to simplify the elicitation of the questionnaire parameters. An application of this tool for the diag- nosis of mental disorders is also discussed together with some implementation details.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Credal networks are a popular class of imprecise prob- abilistic graphical models obtained as a Bayesian net- work generalization based on, so-called credal, sets of probability mass functions. A Java library called CREMA has been recently released to model, process and query credal networks. Despite the NP-hardness of the (exact) task, a number of algorithms is available to approximate credal network inferences. In this paper we present CREPO, an open repository of synthetic credal networks, provided together with the exact re- sults of inference tasks on these models. A Python tool is also delivered to load these data and interact with CREMA, thus making extremely easy to evaluate and compare existing and novel inference algorithms. To demonstrate such benchmarking scheme, we propose an approximate heuristic to be used inside variable elimination schemes to keep a bound on the maximum number of vertices generated during the combination step. A CREPO-based validation against approximate procedures based on linearization and exact techniques performed in CREMA is finally discussed.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>A test is adaptive when the sequence and number of ques- tions is dynamically tuned on the basis of the estimated skills of the taker. Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, are used for adaptive tests as they allow to model the uncertainty about the questions and the skills in an explainable fashion, especially when coping with multiple skills. A better elicitation of the uncertainty in the question/skills relations can be achieved by interval probabilities. This turns the model into a credal net- work, thus increasing the inferential complexity of the queries required to select questions. This is especially the case for the information-theoretic quantities used as scores to drive the adaptive mechanism. We present an alternative family of scores, based on the mode of the posterior proba- bilities, and hence easier to explain. This makes considerably simpler the evaluation in the credal case, without significantly affecting the quality of the adaptive process. Numerical tests on synthetic and real-world data are used to support this claim.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>When coping with literary texts such as novels or short stories, the extraction of structured informa- tion in the form of a knowledge graph might be hindered by the huge number of possible relations between the entities corresponding to the characters in the novel and the consequent hurdles in gathering supervised information about them. Such issue is addressed here as an unsupervised task empow- ered by transformers: relational sentences in the original text are embedded (with SBERT) and clustered in order to merge together semantically simi- lar relations. All the sentences in the same cluster are finally summarized (with BART) and a descriptive label extracted from the summary. Preliminary tests show that such clustering might successfully detect similar relations, and provide a valuable pre- processing for semi-supervised approaches.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>In recent years probabilistic model checking has become an important area of research because of the diffusion of computational systems of stochastic nature. Despite its great success, standard probabilistic model checking suffers the limitation of requiring a sharp specification of the probabilities governing the model behaviour. The theory of imprecise probabilities offers a natural approach to overcome such limitation by a sensitivity analysis with respect to the values of these parameters. However, only extensions based on discrete-time imprecise Markov chains have been considered so far for such a robust approach to model checking. We present a further extension based on imprecise Markov reward models. In particular, we derive efficient algorithms to compute lower and upper bounds of the expected cumulative reward and probabilistic bounded rewards based on existing results for imprecise Markov chains. These ideas are tested on a real case study involving the spend-down costs of geriatric medicine departments.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Stochastic multi-agent systems raise the necessity to extend probabilistic model checking to the epistemic domain. Results in this direction have been achieved by epistemic extensions of Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic and related Probabilistic Interpreted Systems. The latter, however, suffer of an important limitation: they require the probabilities governing the system’s behaviour to be fully specified. A promising way to overcome this limitation is represented by imprecise probabilities. In this paper we introduce imprecise probabilistic interpreted systems and present a related logical language and model-checking procedures based on recent advances in the study of imprecise Markov processes.</details>&nbsp;

<details class="rc3"><summary>ABS</summary>Missing data present a challenge for most machine learning approaches. When a generative probabilistic model of the data is available, an effective approach is to marginalize missing values out. Probabilistic circuits are expressive generative models that allow for efficient exact inference. However, data is often missing not at random, and marginalization can lead to overconfident and wrong conclusions. In this work, we develop an efficient algorithm for assessing the robustness of classifications made by probabilistic circuits to imputations of the non- ignorable portion of missing data at prediction time. We show that our algorithm is exact when the model satisfies certain constraints, which is the case for the recent proposed Generative Random Forests, that equip Random Forest Classifiers with a full probabilistic model of the data. We also show how to extend our approach to handle non-ignorable missing data at training time.</details>&nbsp;
